  title: Hey helper, how play game?
  description: You can't its impossible (just kidding)

  fields:
    - name: Starting the game
      value: >-
        In the beginning, each player gets to roll a certain number of dice (determined by the game
        maker) that is hidden to everyone else. Each player will then take turns bidding dice.

    - name: Bidding dice
      value: >-
        At the start of the game, the first player starts by saying how many instances of a dice
        they think there will be (like "I think there are five dice that have a face of one"). After the first turn, the
        next player can either bid a higher quantity of dice or a higher dice value
        (example: last turn they bid two threes, this turn i can bid three threes or two fours).

    - name: Call!
      value: >-
        If you think the last person who bid is lying, you can call them out. After a call,
        everyone's die will be revealed. If their bid was incorrect, they lose a die. Otherwise, the
        person who called will lose a die. After someone calls, a new round is started and everyone
        rolls all their dice again. If you have lost all your die, you lose and should feel bad.
